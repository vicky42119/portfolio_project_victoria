    <p class="short-bio"> My name is Victoria, but most people just call me Vicky. These first years at Parsons have really taught me how to explore many different mediums, and here on this website will be featured some of my favorite projects! They consist of a mix between hands on and digital works, hope you'll enjoy this small glimpse of my creative oriented mind.  </p>

    <p>Society has conditioned our minds to believe we can achieve happiness from material goods, that other people’s perception of us is more important than our own. We have imprisoned ourselves in a social hierarchy that believes the more you own the more you are.  As if you can no longer feel whole with just yourself, that you need people’s approval and opinion to set some sort of perverse status. I want to criticise that, question it, question myself through my work. Why do I feel excitement when I get a new piece of clothing? What does it bring me? This artwork questions our consumerist behaviour that has been driven by the desire of achieving a certain social status in our society. It embodies people’s despairing aspiration to be accepted and treated as a higher power, as they have been conditioned to believe material goods play a role in its success. </p>

<p>
  If emotional expression was inaccessible, surviving as a human would be a dangerous experience, or of no interest. Indeed, emotions constitute an essential element of existence; they influence our perceptions and reactions, our way of “being-in-the-world”. However, despite the recognition that emotions play a central role in life, what they are and how they are produced, often remains an enigma. Emotions are a complex phenomenon, & this is exactly why I chose this theme. I think it was almost therapeutic to take the time to sit down and feel the emotions enough to start representing them in a physical form. The final result will be composed of five illustrations, each representing an emotion that I feel almost on a daily basis. I have decided to make the series below using only digital software such as Illustrator, photoshop & procreate. </p>

<p>
  For this project we want to focus on ancient Egypt, one of the oldest civilisations filled with a rich culture that left many of their treasures behind, and more precisely on the tomb of Tutankamun. What drove us to this period of history is the important impact that time may have on its artworks. How is art perceived outside of its context? Does it still have the same value, meaning, is it still viewed the same way? These are the questions that inspired us to search into different artistic movements our world has known.  We tried to find ways to break the barrier of time, to expand it through art, to understand what it would mean to others and what it would do to its original meaning. If we were to live and create in times of the renaissance for example,  how would their civilisation understand us and react? </p>
